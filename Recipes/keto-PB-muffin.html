    <h3>These flourless keto peanut butter muffins are packed with protein to fuel you through your healthy day. An easy recipe
        that makes a fabulous on-the-go keto breakfast.</h3>
    <p>These keto peanut butter muffins are entirely flourless. No almond flour, coconut flour, or peanut flour at all. 
        Instead, they're made with collagen protein powder and peanut butter for structure. It leads to a very unconventional 
        muffin recipe but a delicious one!</p>
    <p>The collagen powder used in this recipe is the brand Perfect Keto. It’s a little pricier than some but it has 
        incredibly clean ingredients from grassfed animals. It also has some delicious flavoured varieties!</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Line the muffin pan: I always recommend silicone or parchment liners, as keto baked goods can 
            stick more than the conventional kind.</li>
        <li>Melt the peanut butter: You want it to be easy to whisk in with the other ingredients so it needs to be almost liquid before 
            you proceed.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the sweetener: Break up any clumps in the sweetener and try to get it well dissolved into the peanut butter. Then 
            add the eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Stir in the dry ingredients: Add the collagen, baking powder, and a bit of salt and whisk until well combined. The batter 
            should be somewhat on the thin side but will thicken up as it sits.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips: I always like to save a few chips for the top of each muffin.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden: The best way to test doneness in keto muffins is the touch test. Simply touch the top of one muffin and 
            if it feels firm, it’s done. Don’t over-bake.</li>
        <li>Other protein powders work very differently than collagen. I once tried egg white protein in a muffin like this and they 
            were very dry. So I really can’t guarantee this recipe with a different kind of protein powder. If you do try, I recommend 
            adding some additional coconut oil or butter (about 1/4 cup) and adding more liquid if necessary. Make sure you don’t 
            over-bake them.</li>
        <li>The salted caramel or peanut butter flavors from Perfect Keto would be great in these muffins. Do keep in mind that 
            flavoured collagen usually contains sweetener so you may want to cut back on the added sweetener.</li>
        <li>Store these keto peanut butter muffins on the counter in an airtight container for up to four days, or in the 
            fridge for a week. They can also be frozen for several months.</li>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter, (creamy, no sugar added)</li>
        <li> tbsp coconut oil, or butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Swerve Brown, See notes</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup collagen protein powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar-free chocolate chips</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a muffin pan with 12 silicone or parchment paper liners.</li>
        <li>Place the peanut butter and coconut oil in a large microwave safe bowl, and microwave until they are melted 
            and can be stirred together. Alternatively, you can melt them in a pan over low heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the sweetener and vanilla extract until well combined, then whisk in the eggs. Add the 
            collagen, baking powder, and salt and stir until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture evenly among the prepared muffin cups and bake 18 to 25 minutes, or until the 
            muffins have risen, are golden brown, and firm to the touch on top.</li>
        <li>Remove and let cool in the pan.</li>
