    <h3>You can never go wrong with a decadent Keto chocolate cake,especially if it is Low-GI, flour-free, nut-free, and gluten-free. You only 
        need a handful of staple ingredients, 20 minutes of active prep time, and a set of basic 
        culinary skills to prepare this deliciously low-carb cake. It makes for an excellent holiday dessert loved by kids and adults alike. </h3>
    <p>The glycemic index (GI) is a value used to measure how much specific foods increase blood sugar levels. When preparing Low Glycemic Keto 
        foods, you need to be aware of all the ingredients’ glycemic indexes. Any value under 55 is considered Low-GI, but keep in 
        mind that not all Low-GI foods are Keto-friendly, and vice versa. This recipe uses ingredients with a very Low-GI, including eggs, 
        butter, erythritol, sugar-free chocolate, orange extract, cocoa powder, and orange zest.</p>
    <p>For this recipe, we have used a semi-sweet sugar-free chocolate bar since it yields a smooth and rich texture while adding a little bit 
        of sweetness. If you follow a Low-GI diet, picking the right chocolate type is essential. You’ll need to choose a 
        brand of chocolate that is sweetened with stevia, erythritol, or another sugar-free sweetener to prevent spikes in glucose levels.</p>
    <p>We kept it simple and served this gooey chocolate cake with some orange zest, but you can definitely serve it to your liking. 
        Some great options include a dusting of cocoa powder, whipped cream, or fresh orange slices.</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Freshly squeezed orange juice is high in carbohydrates and has a high glycemic index of 66-76, causing an immediate spike in blood 
        sugar. Orange zest and extract are more suitable for a Low-GI Keto diet and deliver the flavor needed.</li>
        <li>This recipe calls for the use of a a 8 inch springform pan, however if you don't own one a regular 8 or 9 inch pan will 
            work as well.</li>
        <li>A regular pan will take about 5 to 10 minutes off the baking time so remember to account for that.</li>
        <li>If you dont have a standmixer you can use a hand mixer on the highest setting, it works just as well, but is more of a workout.</li>
        <li>If the cake is not cooled completely when you attempt to remove it from the pan it will crumble and fall apart.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup Dark chocolate chips (sugar free)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup erythritol granulated (I used Swerve granulated but any sweetener with erythritol will work)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon orange zest</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon orange extract</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 300F and line an 8 inch (20 cm) springform pan with parchment paper. Add the chocolate chips to a bowl. 
            Add the butter.</li>
        <li> Add the bowl over a double-boiler and stir until fully melted. Alternatively, you can melt the butter and chocolate in 
            the microwave in 20-second increments. Remove the bowl from the double-boiler or microwave and let the mixture cool to room 
            temperature.</li>
        <li>While the mixture is cooling, crack the eggs and place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat at medium-high 
            speed until soft peaks form. Add the erythritol gradually and keep beating to stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Add the yolks, orange zest, and orange extract to the bowl with the chocolate mixture. Whisk to combine. Make sure 
            the chocolate isn’t hot to avoid cooking the egg yolks.</li>
        <li>Add a third of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate mixture and combine. Add the remaining egg whites and gently 
            fold until a homogeneous mixture forms. Don’t whisk or stir too vigorously to avoid deflating the batter.

                the ideal looking mixture for this step." height="426" width="690"></p></li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and transfer to the oven. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until an inserted 
            toothpick comes out dry. The cake will rise in the oven and then deflate slightly as it cools.</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool completely before removing it from the pan. garnish with orange zest and transfer to a serving plate. 
            Slice into 8 slices and serve.</li>
