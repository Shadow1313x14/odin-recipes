    </p>
    <h1>Important Notes</h1>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Be Carful of pesticides and herbicides! Don't forage from areas you if aren't sure they're free of poisens, no one wants to get sick!</li>
        <li>Rinse blossoms thoroughly and let them mostly dry before removing the petals. If they close thats fine.</li>
        <li>To harvest petals pinch and roll from the base of the flower, the petals will come loose and you can grab them esily with minimal
            green from the base. A little green is fine but too much can add a noteable bitterness to the finished loaf.</li>
        <li>You can use dried petals for the bread but fresh ones are easier and more flavorful.</li>
        <li>Be sure not to over mix! It will make the bread denser than its supposed to be. Stir just until combined for best results.</li>
        <li>It can be stored at room temp in an air tight container for up to 3 days but its best to store it in the fridge to make it last. It can be frozen as well.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 cup clean dandelion petals (Loosely packed)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable or olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Harvest fresh dandelion flowers and remove the yellow petals, avoiding too much of the green part. Rinse and dry the petals if needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F and prepare a loaf pan with parchment paper or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and dandelion petals until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, milk, vegetable oil, and honey until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and gently stir just until combined. Don’t overmix to keep the bread tender.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden and a toothpick comes out clean (about 25–35 minutes). Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve warm or at room temperature for the best honey and floral flavor.</li>
        </ol></p>
