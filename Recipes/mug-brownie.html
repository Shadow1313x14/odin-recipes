    <h3>The perfect 5 minute microwave dessert. 
        Satisfy your brownie craving quickly with this fudgy and delicious Brownie in a Mug. 
        Grab a spoon and dig in!</h3>
        <p>Although this recipe makes one brownie in a mug, I would say that is definitely enough to serve two adults. 
        It is very rich and satisfying, and a little goes a long way. 
        Plus, if youâ€™re like my family, we are definitely topping our brownie with vanilla ice cream, so that stretches it even further.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of Brownie in a Mug recipes floating around the internet, but none of them had everything I wanted. 
        I wanted my brownie to be fudgy, tender, super chocolaty, and it had to be prepared in the actual mug. 
        I did not want to dirty a bunch of dishes to make a single serving brownie. When I discovered this I thought it was perfect!</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Be sure to measure everything properly, small batch and single serving cooking like this leaves less room for error.</li>
        <li>The texture is a tiny bit different from a normal brownie but not enough that it's highly noticeable</li>
        <li>A standard mug size is fine, the recipe works in both a 12oz mug and a 16oz mug.</li>
        <li>Don't over mix, it will make the brownie tough.</li>
        <li>Don't overcook the brownie. Microwaves vary, so start with a minute, then an additional 15-30 seconds as necessary.</li>
        <li>Do <em>not</em> skip the chocolate chips. They make the brownie fudgy.</li>
        <li>Looking for a fun twist? Try one of these: 
            <ul><li>Add a dollop of raspberry jam to the brownie batter.</li> 
                <li>Stir in some chopped peanut butter cups.</li>
                <li>Add a tablespoon of chopped walnuts.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the top with caramel sauce.</li></ul>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chocolate chips (plus more for topping)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, melted coconut oil, or melted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>ice cream, whipped cream, powdered sugar, and/or berries (optional toppings)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Place sugar, flour, cocoa powder and salt in a mug. Use a small whisk or fork, and stir until combined, and free of lumps.</li>
        <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li> 
        <li>Add oil, milk, and vanilla, stir with a spoon or small rubber spatula until just combined (try not to over mix it).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a few additional chocolate chips over the top and cook in the microwave for 60 seconds. 
        Check to see if it is done (no raw batter, fudgy chocolate chips are ok). 
        If necessary, continue cooking in 10 second increments. Time will vary a bit based on the microwave and the size of mug.</li>
        <li>Eat immediately with ice cream, whipped cream, powdered sugar, or berries.</li>
