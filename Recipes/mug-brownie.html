    <h1>Important Notes</h1>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Be sure to measure everything properly, small batch and single serving cooking like this leaves less room for error.</li>
        <li>The texture is a tiny bit different from a normal brownie but not enough that it's highly noticeable</li>
        <li>A standard mug size is fine, the recipe works in both a 12oz mug and a 16oz mug.</li>
        <li>Don't over mix, it will make the brownie tough.</li>
        <li>Don't overcook the brownie. Microwaves vary, so start with a minute, then an additional 15-30 seconds as necessary.</li>
        <li>Do <em>not</em> skip the chocolate chips. They make the brownie fudgy.</li>
        <li>Looking for a fun twist? Try one of these: 
            <ul><li>Add a dollop of raspberry jam to the brownie batter.</li> 
                <li>Stir in some chopped peanut butter cups.</li>
                <li>Add a tablespoon of chopped walnuts.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the top with caramel sauce.</li></ul>
    </ul></p>
