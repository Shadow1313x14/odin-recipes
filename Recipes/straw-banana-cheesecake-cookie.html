    <h3>Strawberry Banana Cheesecake Cookies are soft, buttery cookies loaded with fresh strawberries
        and filled with a creamy, sweet banana cream cheese.</h3>
    <p>While not the easiest thing to make these cookies taste like summer heaven! Since the banana cream cheese filling does need to 
    freeze for about an hour before assembling the cookies, it's possible to extend this time. The scoops of banana cream cheese
    can be stored in the freezer for up to a week. If you are keeping them in there that long, I recommend storing them in a freezer-safe bag
    or container.</p>
    <p>These cookies store a bit differently then other cookies, because of the cream cheese filling they need to be kept refrigerated, so when
       they've cooled completely put them in an airtight container and store them in the fridge. They'll last a week as long as you keep 
       them stored properly, to make them last longer freeze them. To freeze, put them in a single layer on a baking shhet or tray and place 
       in freezer until solid before transfering them to a container.</p>
    <h2>Mix-ins</h2>
    <p>These cookies really do not need any additions, I love them as-is. But, you can certainly try some mix-ins; here are some options:</p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Chocolate chips (semi-sweet, milk, dark, or white chocolate)</li>
        <li>Chopped pecans, walnuts, or almonds</li>
        <li>Rolled oats</li>
        <li>Shredded coconut</li>
        <li>Mini marshmallows</li>
        <li>Graham cracker crumbs</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Ensure the cream cheese has come to room temperature before creaming with the confectioners sugar. This can take 30 
            minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>If you forgot to take out the cream cheese for this recipe, there are a couple of options to get it to room temperature quickly.</li>
            <ul><li><b>Warm Water Method:</b> Place the wrapped block of cream cheese in a bowl of warm water for about 10-15 minutes.
            Flip it over every few minutes or so.
            <li><b>Microwave Method:</b> Remove the cream cheese from its packaging and place it on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave
            it on low power in 15-20-second intervals until it reaches the desired softness. Be careful not to overheat it, as cream cheese
            can quickly become too runny or even melt.</li></ul>
        <li>I like to use unsalted butter to have the most control over the salt in recipes. If using salted butter, 
            you may want to lessen the amount of salt in the cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Fresh strawberries are best in these cookies. I don't recommend using frozen strawberries; they have a 
            higher water content, which can affect the texture of the cookies.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><ul>
        <li>12 ounces (1 1/2 packages) cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>1 large banana, mashed</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup strawberries, washed, finely diced </li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Banana Cream Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Line a plate with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, using a hand mixer, cream together cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 
            mashed banana until smooth. This makes about 2 cups of filling.</li>
        <li>Using a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop, drop 20 even portions of the cream cheese mixture onto the 
            lined plate. Place in the freezer and chill for 1 hour, or until solid.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, using a hand mixer, cream butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract, mixing until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Mix in the chopped strawberries.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Using a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop, drop 40 portions of cookie dough onto a lined baking sheet. Flatten each into a disk shape.</li>
        <li>Place one frozen cream cheese ball in the center of one disk. (You may want to keep the cream cheese balls in the freezer as you 
            assemble the cookies so they don't get too soft.)</li>
        <li>Top with another flattened disk of dough and carefully seal the edges, enclosing the cream cheese filling inside the dough. 
            Repeat with the remaining cookies.</li>
        <li>Place the assembled cookies on the prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies for 16-18 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheets before serving.</li>
