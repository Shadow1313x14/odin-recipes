    <h3>This Keto Big Mac Casserole has all the delicious flavors of a Big Mac without all the carbs. Juicy ground beef, 
        homemade burger sauce, melty cheese, pickles, onions, and sesame seeds. Not only is it quick and easy to make, 
        with less than 30 minutes of cook time, but it is also kid-friendly.</h3>
    <p>The beef is the star of the show in this keto Big Mac casserole. It it juicy and flavorful, cooked with onion, 
        garlic, Worcestershire, salt and pepper.</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>While a Big Mac is typically made with American cheese, this is made with sharp white cheddar cheese. 
            But you can definitely make it with slices of American cheese over top.</li>
        <li>Would it be a Big Mac without the pickles? I used dill pickle slices, but you could also use chopped pickles, or even relish.</li>
        <li>For a bacon burger casserole add some chopped bacon on top!</li>
        <li>Pile a helping of the casserole on top of lettuce and top with some burger sauce or ranch dressing for a Big Mac salad.</li>
        <li>For more of a burger experience, serve a helping of this some Keto Everything Buns, slather on some burger sauce, add sliced 
            pickles, extra cheese and shredded lettuce.</li>
        <li> Store the leftover keto Big Mac casserole in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        <li>Reheat the leftover Big Mac casserole in the microwave or in a pan on the stovetop.</li>
