    <p>These are a great recipe, made with almond flour, with some extra pointers on how to get them to come out perfectly 
        every time. Practice makes perfect!</p>
    <p>Crepes make for both a great weekday breakfast when your in a hurry and an amazing food to make in large batches for meals!</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Cream cheese is integral to this recipe, because it gives almond flour crepes more structure and stability. But be 
            sure it’s properly softened so that it blends well into the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>You need a good blender for this recipe, to make the perfect smooth crepe batter. It simplifies the process and 
            combines the ingredients to perfection. I use my Blendtec but any decent blender will do.</li>
        <li>Blending the ingredients tends to make the batter a bit frothy. Letting it rest 5 minutes allows it to smooth out and 
            also thicken a bit.</li>
        <li>A good non-stick pan is important and I find that I only need to add a 1/2 teaspoon of oil or so for the first crepe, 
            and then I don’t need to add any more for the rest of the recipe. If I add too much, it messes up the batter and tends 
            to brown the crepes too quickly.</li>
        <li>Add only about 3 tablespoons of batter, and then pick the pan up and swirl quickly. This move takes a bit of 
            practice but it’s the best way to spread the crepe batter.</li>
        <li>You can’t hurry this part. Keep your eye on the crepes and once the edges are quite dry, you can gently loosen 
            with a spatula and see if it’s cooked on the bottom. It should be light golden brown.</li>
        <li>Unconventional maybe, but it works. Here’s what I do: I let the edges set and once they are dry, I use a thin spatula to 
            loosen them from the pan. Then I lift the far side with the spatula, and grab the edge with my fingers. I put down 
            the spatula and grab the edge with that hand too. Then I gently peel it from the pan and flip it over.</li>
        <li>The great news is that these crepes can be made ahead and stored in the fridge for several days. Keep in an airtight 
            container and store in the fridge. Great for meal planning!</li>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp granulated Swerve Sweetener</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>Oil or butter for the pan</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine cream cheese, eggs, almond flour, sweetener, almond milk and salt. Puree until smooth and well combined. 
            Let rest 5 minutes. (you can put the ingredients in a bowl and use an immersion blender after mixing if you wish.)</li>
        <li>Set a 10-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Add just enough oil or butter to the pan to lightly coat it. Once hot, 
            add a few tbsp of batter to the pan and swirl or spread into a thin layer that reaches almost to the edges (8 to 9 inches 
            in diameter).</li>
        <li>Cook until edges are cooked and can be loosened with a spatula. Loosen all the way around and then lift one edge gently 
            and work spatula underneath (I found it easiest to grab the loosened edge with my fingers while working the spatula under 
            the crepe so I could flip it).</li>
        <li>Flip and cook on the other side until lightly browned. Remove and lay on prepared baking sheet, then continue with remaining 
            batter. You can layer another piece of parchment on top of the first set of crepes as more come off the pan.</li>
        <li>Fill with whatever your little heart desires.</li>
