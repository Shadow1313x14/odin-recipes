    <h3>This keto crepe cake is as delicious as it is beautiful. It features multiple layers of keto crepes with fluffy whipped 
        cream and a rich sugar-free chocolate ganache frosting. No baking required and only 4g net carbs per serving!</h3>
    <p>Imagine a keto cake recipe with multiple thin layers of tender cake and sweet whipped cream filling, all covered in layers of rich
        chocolate ganache. Seems too good to be true, right?</p>
    <p>Well that, my friends, is what you have before you in this delectable keto crepe cake. Ten delicious almond flour crepes layered with 
        espresso whipped cream, and smothered in chocolate. You don't have to use espresso whipped cream if you don't want to.</p>
    <p>Making crepes isn’t difficult, but it is a bit of a labor of love as you have to make them one at a time. Once that part is complete, 
        this cake is easy to make.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>The Crepes</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Use a non-stick pan. Make sure it’s very good and very non-stick so that you can flip the crepes. And only use 
            just the smallest amount of oil. I find that after the first crepe, I don’t need to use any more the rest of the time.</li>
        <li>Blend the batter. This is vital to making a cohesive batter so you really need a blender or a food processor.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat low. Depending on the strength of your stove, you may need low or medium low. Just don’t let that 
            pan get too hot or the batter starts cooking too quickly and you can’t spread it thinly enough.</li>
        <li>Swirl the pan quickly, so that the batter spreads toward the edges. This takes a little bit of practice.</li>
        <li>Flip carefully. Please read the instructions in the Keto Crepe recipe for how to flip them.</li>
        <li>Don’t panic! If your crepes rip a bit here and there, they still work well as layers for the cake. No one will 
            see the breaks.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>The Filling</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Whip the cream to stiff peaks. You need the cream to hold up to layering so make sure the peaks stand up when you lift the 
            beater.</li>
        <li>Layer the crepes and whipped cream. If you get 10 crepes, as I did, you can use about 1/3 cup of whipped cream per layer.</li>
        <li>Leave the top crepe naked. Don’t spread it with any cream, as it will be hard to spread the glaze if you do.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate. At this point, the whole cake will be quite soft. Chill it 1 hour to firm up so you can spread the glaze 
            properly.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>The Ganache</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Bring the cream to a simmer. Don’t let it boil, but you do want it to be bubbling quite a bit before you remove it from the
            heat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for about 5 minutes to melt, then whisk in the sweetener and vanilla extract until 
            smooth.</li>
        <li>Let it thicken. It will continue to thicken as it cools so leave it for 5 to 10 minutes before attempting to spread it 
            over the cake.</li>
        <li>Pour it slowly over the top. You can spread it over the sides as it drips down, or you can simply let the drips be the 
            decoration. I like the look of the fully coated cake but it’s a messy process!</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>This cake can be made a day in advance but I wouldn’t do it any earlier than that. Whipped cream filling is soft and can 
            get a little messy after a few days.</li>
        <li>Keep this cake refrigerated until ready to serve. If you want the ganache to be a bit softer, allow it to sit out for 10 
            to 15 minutes before cutting. Keep leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge so it doesn’t dry out.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cake</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>1 recipe <a href="../Recipes/keto-crepes.html">keto crepes</a></li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup powdered Swerve Sweetener</li>
        <li>2 tsp instant espresso powder, (optional)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Chocolate Glaze</h3>
    <p><ul>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>1/3 cup powdered Swerve Sweetener</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Cake</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Prepare the crepes as directed and set aside to cool. You should get 10 to 12 thin crepes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cream, sweetener, espresso powder if using, and vanilla. Whip until the cream holds 
            stiff peaks.</li>
        <li>Place one crepe on a cake platter and top with a thin layer of the whipped cream, spreading all the way to the edges. 
            Depending on how many crepes you got, you can use about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup per layer.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all the crepes and whipped cream are used up, leaving the top crepe without any cream on top. 
            Refrigerate 1 hour to firm up</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Chocolate Glaze</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a simmer. Remove from heat and add the chopped chocolate.</li>
        <li>Let sit 5 minutes to melt the chocolate, then whisk in the sweeteners and vanilla until smooth.</li>
        <li>Let cool another 5 to 10  minutes to thicken, then slowly pour over the cake. Use an offset spatula to spread it over 
            the sides of the cake, a little at a time. Or you can simply let it drip down the sides.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate 30 minutes to help set the glaze.</li>
        <li>Enjoy a slice of your cake!</li>
